# 🫀 Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning  
## A Comparative Study of MLP, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes  

## Project Overview
This project was developed as a final assignment for the Machine Learning course.  
The objective of this study is to perform a comparative analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify cardiac catheterization (Cath) outcomes based on clinical features.

The project implements multiple classification models and evaluates their performance to determine the most effective algorithm for predicting heart disease outcomes.

## Model Performance Comparison

| Model           | Accuracy (%) |
|----------------|--------------|
| MLP (Tuned)    | 80.33       |
| MLP            | 80.33       |
| Random Forest  | 77.05       |
| Naive Bayes    | 75.41       |

The tuned MLP model achieved the highest accuracy of **80.33%**, indicating its effectiveness in modeling the dataset.
